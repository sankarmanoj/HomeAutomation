Protocol for Serial Communication between Arduino and a Computer for Home Automation

Arduino will interface with hardware devices, which control objects like Doors, Lights, Fans, or Curtains.
Each Contol Object will have its own class of the same name in singular with the first leter capital.
Each class will have a unique integer corresponding to it.
This will recieve a value from 0 to 100. Depending the object, it can have continous change or boolean, where non-zero is treated as ON.
Each instance of the object will be uniquely identified by a 4 character string.

The Arduino will recieve a string through its serial interface from a controller.
This Control String will begin with a tilde symbol ("~").
Then it will read the integer, corresponding to the class of the object, followed by a pipe ("|") to seperate this from the next control string.
The pipe is followed by a 4 digit char like ("fanC"), which uniquely identifies the object to be controlled, and the pipe ("|")
Following the pipe is the control value for the device, which is between 0 and 100.
The entire control string is terminated by a exclamation mark ("!"), which on recieveing , the control string will be implemented.
